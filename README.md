# Flight Delay Prediction System

A system made to predict flight delays using Machine Learning models.


## Pre-requisite

Install the NYC Flights Dataset from Kaggle.<br>
[Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/varunmarvah/nyc-flights-dataset-exploratory-analysis)


## Installation and Deployment

1. To setup this project, install necessary external libraries mentioned below in terminal.

```bash
  pip install streamlit
  pip install joblib
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook(.ipynb) once to create the flight_recommend.pkl and encoders.pkl file in your local system.

3. Run app.py file using the streamlit command.

```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```


## Features of the system

- Flight departure delay prediction
- Fast and effective
- User friendly UI using Streamlit
